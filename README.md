This project uses Python and the Hugging Face transformers library to summarize online articles. It leverages a pre-trained summarization pipeline and web scraping with BeautifulSoup to extract text from a URL, process it, and generate concise summaries.

**Features**

Scrapes the text content from an article using BeautifulSoup.
Processes and organizes the text into manageable chunks for summarization.
Summarizes text efficiently using Hugging Face's summarization pipeline.
Outputs the summary to a text file (blogsummry.txt).
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Required Python Libraries:
transformers
beautifulsoup4
requests
Install dependencies with:

**Copy code:**

pip install transformers beautifulsoup4 requests

**How It Works:**

Initialize Summarizer
The Hugging Face pipeline for summarization is initialized to handle the summarization tasks.

**Web Scraping:**

The program fetches content from a specified URL using requests.
BeautifulSoup parses the HTML and extracts text from h1 and p tags.
Text Processing

The extracted text is processed into chunks of less than 500 words.
This ensures compatibility with the summarizer’s input limits.
Summarization

Each chunk is summarized using the pre-trained summarization pipeline.
All summaries are combined into a single cohesive summary.
Output
The final summary is saved to a text file named blogsummry.txt.


**How to Run:**

Replace the URL variable with the link to the article you want to summarize:

python
Copy code
URL = "https://example.com/article"


**Copy code:**

python summarizer.py
View the summary in the generated blogsummry.txt file.

**Customization:**

Change Summarization Model:
Modify the summarization pipeline to use different models from Hugging Face’s library if needed. Be aware of storage and compatibility.

**Adjust Summary Length:**

Update the max_length and min_length parameters in the summarizer call to control the length of the summary.

**Limitations:
Scraper Specificity:**

This script targets articles with h1 and p tags. It might need adjustments for differently structured websites.

**Text Length:**

Articles exceeding the maximum token limit may require further splitting or alternate summarization methods.
